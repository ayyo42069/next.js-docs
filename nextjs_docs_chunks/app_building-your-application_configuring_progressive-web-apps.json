Implementing Web Push Notifications](#2-implementing-web-push-notifications)\n\nWeb Push Notifications are supported with all modern browsers, including:\n\n* iOS 16.4+ for applications installed to the home screen\n* Safari 16 for macOS 13 or later\n* Chromium based browsers\n* Firefox\n\nThis makes PWAs a viable alternative to native apps. Notably, you can trigger install prompts without needing offline support.\n\nWeb Push Notifications allow you to re-engage users even when they're not actively using your app. Here's how to implement them in a Next.js application:\n\nFirst, let's create the main page component in `app/page.tsx`. We'll break it down into smaller parts for better understanding. First, we\u2019ll add some of the imports and utilities we\u2019ll need. It\u2019s okay that the referenced Server Actions do not yet exist:\n\n```\n'use client'\n \nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { subscribeUser, unsubscribeUser, sendNotification } from './actions'\n \nfunction urlBase64ToUint8Array(base64String: string) {\n  const padding = '='.repeat((4 - (base64String.length % 4)) % 4)\n  const base64 = (base64String + padding).replace(/-/g, '+').replace(/_/g, '/')\n \n  const rawData = window.atob(base64)\n  const outputArray = new Uint8Array(rawData.length)\n \n  for (let i = 0; i < rawData.length; ++i) {\n    outputArray[i] = rawData.charCodeAt(i)\n  }\n  return outputArray\n}\n```\n\nLet\u2019s now add a component to manage subscribing, unsubscribing, and sending push notifications.\n\n```\nfunction PushNotificationManager() {\n  const [isSupported, setIsSupported] = useState(false)\n  const [subscription, setSubscription] = useState<PushSubscription | null>(\n    null\n  )\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('')\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    if ('serviceWorker' in navigator && 'PushManager' in window) {\n      setIsSupported(true)\n      registerServiceWorker()\n    }\n  }, [])\n \n  async function registerServiceWorker() {\n    const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js', {\n      scope: '/',\n      updateViaCache: 'none',\n    })\n    const sub = await registration.pushManager.getSubscription()\n    setSubscription(sub)\n  }\n \n  async function subscribeToPush() {\n    const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready\n    const sub = await registration.pushManager.subscribe({\n      userVisibleOnly: true,\n      applicationServerKey: urlBase64ToUint8Array(\n        process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY!\n      ),\n    })\n    setSubscription(sub)\n    const serializedSub = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(sub))\n    await subscribeUser(serializedSub)\n  }\n \n  async function unsubscribeFromPush() {\n    await subscription?.unsubscribe()\n    setSubscription(null)\n    await unsubscribeUser()\n  }\n \n  async function sendTestNotification() {\n    if (subscription) {\n      await sendNotification(message)\n      setMessage('')\n    }\n  }\n \n  if (!isSupported) {\n    return <p>Push notifications are not supported in this browser.</p>\n  }\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h3>Push Notifications</h3>\n      {subscription ? (\n        <>\n          <p>You are subscribed to push notifications.</p>\n          <button onClick={unsubscribeFromPush}>Unsubscribe</button>\n          <input\n            type=\"text\"\n            placeholder=\"Enter notification message\"\n            value={message}\n            onChange={(e) => setMessage(e.target.value)}\n          />\n          <button onClick={sendTestNotification}>Send Test</button>\n        </>\n      ) : (\n        <>\n          <p>You are not subscribed to push notifications.</p>\n          <button onClick={subscribeToPush}>Subscribe</button>\n        </>\n      )}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nFinally, let\u2019s create a component to show a message for iOS devices to instruct them to install to their home screen, and only show this if the app is not already installed.\n\n```\nfunction InstallPrompt() {\n  const [isIOS, setIsIOS] = useState(false)\n  const [isStandalone, setIsStandalone] = useState(false)\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    setIsIOS(\n      /iPad|iPhone|iPod/.test(navigator.userAgent) && !(window as any).MSStream\n    )\n \n    setIsStandalone(window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches)\n  }, [])\n \n  if (isStandalone) {\n    return null // Don't show install button if already installed\n  }\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h3>Install App</h3>\n      <button>Add to Home Screen</button>\n      {isIOS && (\n        <p>\n          To install this app on your iOS device, tap the share button\n          <span role=\"img\" aria-label=\"share icon\">\n            {' '}\n            \u238b{' '}\n          </span>\n          and then \"Add to Home Screen\"\n          <span role=\"img\" aria-label=\"plus icon\">\n            {' '}\n            \u2795{' '}\n          </span>.\n        </p>\n      )}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <PushNotificationManager />\n      <InstallPrompt />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nNow, let\u2019s create the Server Actions which this file calls.",

Service Worker Specific Headers:\n   1. `Content-Type: application/javascript; charset=utf-8`: Ensures the service worker is interpreted correctly as JavaScript.\n   2. `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`: Prevents caching of the service worker, ensuring users always get the latest version.\n   3. `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'`: Implements a strict Content Security Policy for the service worker, only allowing scripts from the same origin.\n\nLearn more about defining [Content Security Policies](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/content-security-policy) with Next.js.",

Consider exploring features like background sync, periodic background sync, or the File System Access API to enhance your application. For inspiration and up-to-date information on PWA capabilities, you can refer to resources like [What PWA Can Do Today](https://whatpwacando.today/).\n2. **Static Exports:** If your application requires not running a server, and instead using a static export of files, you can update the Next.js configuration to enable this change. Learn more in the [Next.js Static Export documentation](/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports). However, you will need to move from Server Actions to calling an external API, as well as moving your defined headers to your proxy.\n3. **Offline Support**: To provide offline functionality, one option is [Serwist](https://github.com/serwist/serwist) with Next.js. You can find an example of how to integrate Serwist with Next.js in their [documentation](https://github.com/serwist/serwist/tree/main/examples/next-basic). **Note:** this plugin currently requires webpack configuration.\n4. **Security Considerations**: Ensure that your service worker is properly secured. This includes using HTTPS, validating the source of push messages, and implementing proper error handling.\n5. **User Experience**: Consider implementing progressive enhancement techniques to ensure your app works well even when certain PWA features are not supported by the user's browser.",

However, this function contains an `API_KEY`, written with the intention that it would only ever be executed on the server.\n\nSince the environment variable `API_KEY` is not prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC`, it's a private variable that can only be accessed on the server. To prevent your environment variables from being leaked to the client, Next.js replaces private environment variables with an empty string.\n\nAs a result, even though `getData()` can be imported and executed on the client, it won't work as expected. And while making the variable public would make the function work on the client, you may not want to expose sensitive information to the client.\n\nTo prevent this sort of unintended client usage of server code, we can use the `server-only` package to give other developers a build-time error if they ever accidentally import one of these modules into a Client Component.\n\nTo use `server-only`, first install the package:\n\nTerminal\n\n```\nnpm install server-only\n```\n\nThen import the package into any module that contains server-only code:\n\nlib/data.js\n\n```\nimport 'server-only'\n \nexport async function getData() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {\n    headers: {\n      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,\n    },\n  })\n \n  return res.json()\n}\n```\n\nNow, any Client Component that imports `getData()` will receive a build-time error explaining that this module can only be used on the server.\n\nThe corresponding package `client-only` can be used to mark modules that contain client-only code \u2013 for example, code that accesses the `window` object.",

    "heading_level": 3,
    "content": "### [Using Third-party Packages and Providers](#using-third-party-packages-and-providers)\n\nSince Server Components are a new React feature, third-party packages and providers in the ecosystem are just beginning to add the `\"use client\"` directive to components that use client-only features like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `createContext`.\n\nToday, many components from `npm` packages that use client-only features do not yet have the directive. These third-party components will work as expected within Client Components since they have the `\"use client\"` directive, but they won't work within Server Components.\n\nFor example, let's say you've installed the hypothetical `acme-carousel` package which has a `<Carousel />` component. This component uses `useState`, but it doesn't yet have the `\"use client\"` directive.\n\nIf you use `<Carousel />` within a Client Component, it will work as expected:\n\napp/gallery.tsx\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\n'use client'\n \nimport { useState } from 'react'\nimport { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'\n \nexport default function Gallery() {\n  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>View pictures</button>\n \n      {/* Works, since Carousel is used within a Client Component */}\n      {isOpen && <Carousel />}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nHowever, if you try to use it directly within a Server Component, you'll see an error:\n\napp/page.tsx\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\nimport { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>View pictures</p>\n \n      {/* Error: `useState` can not be used within Server Components */}\n      <Carousel />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThis is because Next.js doesn't know `<Carousel />` is using client-only features.\n\nTo fix this, you can wrap third-party components that rely on client-only features in your own Client Components:\n\napp/carousel.tsx\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\n'use client'\n \nimport { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'\n \nexport default Carousel\n```\n\nNow, you can use `<Carousel />` directly within a Server Component:\n\napp/page.tsx\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\nimport Carousel from './carousel'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>View pictures</p>\n \n      {/*  Works, since Carousel is a Client Component */}\n      <Carousel />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nWe don't expect you to need to wrap most third-party components since it's likely you'll be using them within Client Components. However, one exception is providers, since they rely on React state and context, and are typically needed at the root of an application. [Learn more about third-party context providers below](#using-context-providers).\n\n#### [Using Context Providers](#using-context-providers)\n\nContext providers are typically rendered near the root of an application to share global concerns, like the current theme. Since [React context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) is not supported in Server Components, trying to create a context at the root of your application will cause an error:\n\napp/layout.tsx\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\nimport { createContext } from 'react'\n \n//  createContext is not supported in Server Components\nexport const ThemeContext = createContext({})\n \nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"dark\">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nTo fix this, create your context and render its provider inside of a Client Component:\n\napp/theme-provider.tsx\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\n'use client'\n \nimport { createContext } from 'react'\n \nexport const ThemeContext = createContext({})\n \nexport default function ThemeProvider({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"dark\">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>\n}\n```\n\nYour Server Component will now be able to directly render your provider since it's been marked as a Client Component:\n\napp/layout.tsx\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\nimport ThemeProvider from './theme-provider'\n \nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nWith the provider rendered at the root, all other Client Components throughout your app will be able to consume this context.\n\n> **Good to know**: You should render providers as deep as possible in the tree \u2013 notice how `ThemeProvider` only wraps `{children}` instead of the entire `<html>` document. This makes it easier for Next.js to optimize the static parts of your Server Components.\n\n#### [Advice for Library Authors](#advice-for-library-authors)\n\nIn a similar fashion, library authors creating packages to be consumed by other developers can use the `\"use client\"` directive to mark client entry points of their package. This allows users of the package to import package components directly into their Server Components without having to create a wrapping boundary.\n\nYou can optimize your package by using ['use client' deeper in the tree](#moving-client-components-down-the-tree), allowing the imported modules to be part of the Server Component module graph.\n\nIt's worth noting some bundlers might strip out `\"use client\"` directives. You can find an example of how to configure esbuild to include the `\"use client\"` directive in the [React Wrap Balancer](https://github.com/shuding/react-wrap-balancer/blob/main/tsup.config.ts#L10-L13) and [Vercel Analytics](https://github.com/vercel/analytics/blob/main/packages/web/tsup.config.js#L26-L30) repositories.",

Starting with the [root layout](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#root-layout-required), which is a Server Component, you can then render certain subtrees of components on the client by adding the `\"use client\"` directive.\n\nWithin those client subtrees, you can still nest Server Components or call Server Actions, however there are some things to keep in mind:\n\n* During a request-response lifecycle, your code moves from the server to the client. If you need to access data or resources on the server while on the client, you'll be making a **new** request to the server - not switching back and forth.\n* When a new request is made to the server, all Server Components are rendered first, including those nested inside Client Components. The rendered result ([RSC Payload](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#what-is-the-react-server-component-payload-rsc)) will contain references to the locations of Client Components. Then, on the client, React uses the RSC Payload to reconcile Server and Client Components into a single tree.\n\n* Since Client Components are rendered after Server Components, you cannot import a Server Component into a Client Component module (since it would require a new request back to the server).

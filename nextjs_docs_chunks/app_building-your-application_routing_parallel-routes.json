For example, the following file structure defines two slots: `@analytics` and `@team`:\n\n[Image: Parallel Routes File-system Structure][Image: Parallel Routes File-system Structure]\n\nSlots are passed as props to the shared parent layout. For the example above, the component in `app/layout.js` now accepts the `@analytics` and `@team` slots props, and can render them in parallel alongside the `children` prop:\n\napp/layout.tsx\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\nexport default function Layout({\n  children,\n  team,\n  analytics,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  analytics: React.ReactNode\n  team: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      {children}\n      {team}\n      {analytics}\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nHowever, slots are **not** route segments and do not affect the URL structure. For example, for `/@analytics/views`, the URL will be `/views` since `@analytics` is a slot. Slots are combined with the regular [Page](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page) component to form the final page associated with the route segment. Because of this, you cannot have separate [static](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#static-rendering-default) and [dynamic](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-rendering) slots at the same route segment level. If one slot is dynamic, all slots at that level must be dynamic.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> * The `children` prop is an implicit slot that does not need to be mapped to a folder.

    "content": "### [Modals](#modals)\n\nParallel Routes can be used together with [Intercepting Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/intercepting-routes) to create modals that support deep linking. This allows you to solve common challenges when building modals, such as:\n\n* Making the modal content **shareable through a URL**.\n* **Preserving context** when the page is refreshed, instead of closing the modal.\n* **Closing the modal on backwards navigation** rather than going to the previous route.\n* **Reopening the modal on forwards navigation**.\n\nConsider the following UI pattern, where a user can open a login modal from a layout using client-side navigation, or access a separate `/login` page:\n\n[Image: Parallel Routes Diagram][Image: Parallel Routes Diagram]\n\nTo implement this pattern, start by creating a `/login` route that renders your **main** login page.\n\n[Image: Parallel Routes Diagram][Image: Parallel Routes Diagram]\n\napp/login/page.tsx\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\nimport { Login } from '@/app/ui/login'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Login />\n}\n```\n\nThen, inside the `@auth` slot, add [`default.js`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/default) file that returns `null`. This ensures that the modal is not rendered when it's not active.\n\napp/@auth/default.tsx\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\nexport default function Default() {\n  return null\n}\n```\n\nInside your `@auth` slot, intercept the `/login` route by updating the `/(.)login` folder. Import the `<Modal>` component and its children into the `/(.)login/page.tsx` file:\n\napp/@auth/(.)login/page.tsx\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\nimport { Modal } from '@/app/ui/modal'\nimport { Login } from '@/app/ui/login'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Modal>\n      <Login />\n    </Modal>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know:**\n>\n> * The convention used to intercept the route, e.g. `(.)`, depends on your file-system structure. See [Intercepting Routes convention](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/intercepting-routes#convention).\n> * By separating the `<Modal>` functionality from the modal content (`<Login>`), you can ensure any content inside the modal, e.g. [forms](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations#forms), are Server Components. See [Interleaving Client and Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/composition-patterns#supported-pattern-passing-server-components-to-client-components-as-props) for more information.\n\n#### [Opening the modal](#opening-the-modal)\n\nNow, you can leverage the Next.js router to open and close the modal. This ensures the URL is correctly updated when the modal is open, and when navigating backwards and forwards.\n\nTo open the modal, pass the `@auth` slot as a prop to the parent layout and render it alongside the `children` prop.\n\napp/layout.tsx\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Layout({\n  auth,\n  children,\n}: {\n  auth: React.ReactNode\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <nav>\n        <Link href=\"/login\">Open modal</Link>\n      </nav>\n      <div>{auth}</div>\n      <div>{children}</div>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nWhen the user clicks the `<Link>`, the modal will open instead of navigating to the `/login` page. However, on refresh or initial load, navigating to `/login` will take the user to the main login page.\n\n#### [Closing the modal](#closing-the-modal)\n\nYou can close the modal by calling `router.back()` or by using the `Link` component.\n\napp/ui/modal.tsx\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\n'use client'\n \nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport function Modal({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <button\n        onClick={() => {\n          router.back()\n        }}\n      >\n        Close modal\n      </button>\n      <div>{children}</div>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nWhen using the `Link` component to navigate away from a page that shouldn't render the `@auth` slot anymore, we need to make sure the parallel route matches to a component that returns `null`. For example, when navigating back to the root page, we create a `@auth/page.tsx` component:\n\napp/ui/modal.tsx\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport function Modal({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Link href=\"/\">Close modal</Link>\n      <div>{children}</div>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\napp/@auth/page.tsx\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\nexport default function Page() {\n  return null\n}\n```\n\nOr if navigating to any other page (such as `/foo`, `/foo/bar`, etc), you can use a catch-all slot:\n\napp/@auth/[...catchAll]/page.tsx\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\nexport default function CatchAll() {\n  return null\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know:**\n>\n> * We use a catch-all route in our `@auth` slot to close the modal because of the behavior described in [Active state and navigation](#active-state-and-navigation). Since client-side navigations to a route that no longer match the slot will remain visible, we need to match the slot to a route that returns `null` to close the modal.\n> * Other examples could include opening a photo modal in a gallery while also having a dedicated `/photo/[id]` page, or opening a shopping cart in a side modal.\n> * [View an example](https://github.com/vercel-labs/nextgram) of modals with Intercepted and Parallel Routes.",

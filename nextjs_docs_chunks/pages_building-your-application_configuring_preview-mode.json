However, it\u2019s not ideal when you\u2019re writing a draft on your headless CMS and want to **preview** the draft immediately on your page. You\u2019d want Next.js to render these pages at **request time** instead of build time and fetch the draft content instead of the published content. You\u2019d want Next.js to bypass Static Generation only for this specific case.\n\nNext.js has a feature called **Preview Mode** which solves this problem. Here are instructions on how to use it.",

Any requests to Next.js containing these cookies will be considered as the **preview mode**, and the behavior for statically generated pages will change (more on this later).\n\nYou can test this manually by creating an API route like below and accessing it from your browser manually:\n\npages/api/preview.js\n\n```\n// simple example for testing it manually from your browser.\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  res.setPreviewData({})\n  res.end('Preview mode enabled')\n}\n```\n\nIf you open your browser\u2019s developer tools and visit `/api/preview`, you\u2019ll notice that the `__prerender_bypass` and `__next_preview_data` cookies will be set on this request.",

The specific steps will vary depending on which headless CMS you\u2019re using, but here are some common steps you could take.\n\nThese steps assume that the headless CMS you\u2019re using supports setting **custom preview URLs**. If it doesn\u2019t, you can still use this method to secure your preview URLs, but you\u2019ll need to construct and access the preview URL manually.\n\n**First**, you should create a **secret token string** using a token generator of your choice. This secret will only be known by your Next.js app and your headless CMS. This secret prevents people who don\u2019t have access to your CMS from accessing preview URLs.\n\n**Second**, if your headless CMS supports setting custom preview URLs, specify the following as the preview URL. This assumes that your preview API route is located at `pages/api/preview.js`.\n\nTerminal\n\n```\nhttps://<your-site>/api/preview?secret=<token>&slug=<path>\n```\n\n* `<your-site>` should be your deployment domain.\n* `<token>` should be replaced with the secret token you generated.\n* `<path>` should be the path for the page that you want to preview. If you want to preview `/posts/foo`, then you should use `&slug=/posts/foo`.\n\nYour headless CMS might allow you to include a variable in the preview URL so that `<path>` can be set dynamically based on the CMS\u2019s data like so: `&slug=/posts/{entry.fields.slug}`\n\n**Finally**, in the preview API route:\n\n* Check that the secret matches and that the `slug` parameter exists (if not, the request should fail).\n* Call `res.setPreviewData`.\n* Then redirect the browser to the path specified by `slug`. (The following example uses a [307 redirect](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/307)).\n\n```\nexport default async (req, res) => {\n  // Check the secret and next parameters\n  // This secret should only be known to this API route and the CMS\n  if (req.query.secret !== 'MY_SECRET_TOKEN' || !req.query.slug) {\n    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid token' })\n  }\n \n  // Fetch the headless CMS to check if the provided `slug` exists\n  // getPostBySlug would implement the required fetching logic to the headless CMS\n  const post = await getPostBySlug(req.query.slug)\n \n  // If the slug doesn't exist prevent preview mode from being enabled\n  if (!post) {\n    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid slug' })\n  }\n \n  // Enable Preview Mode by setting the cookies\n  res.setPreviewData({})\n \n  // Redirect to the path from the fetched post\n  // We don't redirect to req.query.slug as that might lead to open redirect vulnerabilities\n  res.redirect(post.slug)\n}\n```\n\nIf it succeeds, then the browser will be redirected to the path you want to preview with the preview mode cookies being set.",

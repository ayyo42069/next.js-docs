You can edit\n  anything in that file, including styles, rendering logic, event handlers, or\n  effects.\n* If you edit a file with exports that *aren't* React components, Fast Refresh\n  will re-run both that file, and the other files importing it. So if both\n  `Button.js` and `Modal.js` import `theme.js`, editing `theme.js` will update\n  both components.\n* Finally, if you **edit a file** that's **imported by files outside of the\n  React tree**, Fast Refresh **will fall back to doing a full reload**. You\n  might have a file which renders a React component but also exports a value\n  that is imported by a **non-React component**. For example, maybe your\n  component also exports a constant, and a non-React utility file imports it. In\n  that case, consider migrating the constant to a separate file and importing it\n  into both files. This will re-enable Fast Refresh to work. Other cases can\n  usually be solved in a similar way.",

Here's a few reasons why you might see\nlocal state being reset on every edit to a file:\n\n* Local state is not preserved for class components (only function components\n  and Hooks preserve state).\n* The file you're editing might have *other* exports in addition to a React\n  component.\n* Sometimes, a file would export the result of calling a higher-order component\n  like `HOC(WrappedComponent)`. If the returned component is a\n  class, its state will be reset.\n* Anonymous arrow functions like `export default () => <div />;` cause Fast Refresh to not preserve local component state. For large codebases you can use our [`name-default-component` codemod](/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#name-default-component).\n\nAs more of your codebase moves to function components and Hooks, you can expect\nstate to be preserved in more cases.",

For example, this can be handy if you're tweaking an animation\n  that only happens on mount. To do this, you can add `// @refresh reset`\n  anywhere in the file you're editing. This directive is local to the file, and\n  instructs Fast Refresh to remount components defined in that file on every\n  edit.\n* You can put `console.log` or `debugger;` into the components you edit during\n  development.\n* Remember that imports are case sensitive. Both fast and full refresh can fail,\n  when your import doesn't match the actual filename.\n  For example, `'./header'` vs `'./Header'`.",

Their list of dependencies will be ignored\nwhile Fast Refresh is happening.\n\nFor example, when you edit `useMemo(() => x * 2, [x])` to\n`useMemo(() => x * 10, [x])`, it will re-run even though `x` (the dependency)\nhas not changed.

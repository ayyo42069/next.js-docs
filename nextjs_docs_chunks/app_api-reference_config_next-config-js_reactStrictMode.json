You can still disable Strict Mode by setting `reactStrictMode: false`.\n\n> **Suggested**: We strongly suggest you enable Strict Mode in your Next.js application to better prepare your application for the future of React.\n\nReact's [Strict Mode](https://react.dev/reference/react/StrictMode) is a development mode only feature for highlighting potential problems in an application. It helps to identify unsafe lifecycles, legacy API usage, and a number of other features.\n\nThe Next.js runtime is Strict Mode-compliant. To opt-in to Strict Mode, configure the following option in your `next.config.js`:\n\nnext.config.js\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  reactStrictMode: true,\n}\n```\n\nIf you or your team are not ready to use Strict Mode in your entire application, that's OK! You can incrementally migrate on a page-by-page basis using `<React.StrictMode>`.\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\n\nSend",

    "content": "### [`paths`](#paths)\n\nThe `paths` key determines which paths will be pre-rendered. For example, suppose that you have a page that uses [Dynamic Routes](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) named `pages/posts/[id].js`. If you export `getStaticPaths` from this page and return the following for `paths`:\n\n```\nreturn {\n  paths: [\n    { params: { id: '1' }},\n    {\n      params: { id: '2' },\n      // with i18n configured the locale for the path can be returned as well\n      locale: \"en\",\n    },\n  ],\n  fallback: ...\n}\n```\n\nThen, Next.js will statically generate `/posts/1` and `/posts/2` during `next build` using the page component in `pages/posts/[id].js`.\n\nThe value for each `params` object must match the parameters used in the page name:\n\n* If the page name is `pages/posts/[postId]/[commentId]`, then `params` should contain `postId` and `commentId`.\n* If the page name uses [catch-all routes](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments) like `pages/[...slug]`, then `params` should contain `slug` (which is an array). If this array is `['hello', 'world']`, then Next.js will statically generate the page at `/hello/world`.\n* If the page uses an [optional catch-all route](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#optional-catch-all-segments), use `null`, `[]`, `undefined` or `false` to render the root-most route. For example, if you supply `slug: false` for `pages/[[...slug]]`, Next.js will statically generate the page `/`.\n\nThe `params` strings are **case-sensitive** and ideally should be normalized to ensure the paths are generated correctly. For example, if `WoRLD` is returned for a param it will only match if `WoRLD` is the actual path visited, not `world` or `World`.\n\nSeparate of the `params` object a `locale` field can be returned when [i18n is configured](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/internationalization), which configures the locale for the path being generated.",

Instead, Next.js will serve a [\u201cfallback\u201d](#fallback-pages) version of the page on the first request to such a path. Web crawlers, such as Google, won't be served a fallback and instead the path will behave as in [`fallback: 'blocking'`](#fallback-blocking).\n* When a page with `fallback: true` is navigated to through `next/link` or `next/router` (client-side) Next.js will *not* serve a fallback and instead the page will behave as [`fallback: 'blocking'`](#fallback-blocking).\n* In the background, Next.js will statically generate the requested path `HTML` and `JSON`. This includes running `getStaticProps`.\n* When complete, the browser receives the `JSON` for the generated path. This will be used to automatically render the page with the required props. From the user\u2019s perspective, the page will be swapped from the fallback page to the full page.\n* At the same time, Next.js adds this path to the list of pre-rendered pages. Subsequent requests to the same path will serve the generated page, like other pages pre-rendered at build time.\n\n> **Good to know**: `fallback: true` is not supported when using [`output: 'export'`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports).\n\n#### [When is `fallback: true` useful?](#when-is-fallback-true-useful)\n\n`fallback: true` is useful if your app has a very large number of static pages that depend on data (such as a very large e-commerce site). If you want to pre-render all product pages, the builds would take a very long time.\n\nInstead, you may statically generate a small subset of pages and use `fallback: true` for the rest. When someone requests a page that is not generated yet, the user will see the page with a loading indicator or skeleton component.\n\nShortly after, `getStaticProps` finishes and the page will be rendered with the requested data. From now on, everyone who requests the same page will get the statically pre-rendered page.\n\nThis ensures that users always have a fast experience while preserving fast builds and the benefits of Static Generation.\n\n`fallback: true` will not *update* generated pages, for that take a look at [Incremental Static Regeneration](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration).",

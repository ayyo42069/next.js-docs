    "content": "### [Embedding externally hosted videos](#embedding-externally-hosted-videos)\n\nTo embed videos from external platforms, you can use Next.js to fetch the video information and React Suspense to handle the fallback state while loading.\n\n**1. Create a Server Component for video embedding**\n\nThe first step is to create a [Server Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) that generates the appropriate iframe for embedding the video. This component will fetch the source URL for the video and render the iframe.\n\napp/ui/video-component.jsx\n\n```\nexport default async function VideoComponent() {\n  const src = await getVideoSrc()\n \n  return <iframe src={src} allowFullScreen />\n}\n```\n\n**2. Stream the video component using React Suspense**\n\nAfter creating the Server Component to embed the video, the next step is to [stream](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming) the component using [React Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense).\n\napp/page.jsx\n\n```\nimport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport VideoComponent from '../ui/VideoComponent.jsx'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading video...</p>}>\n        <VideoComponent />\n      </Suspense>\n      {/* Other content of the page */}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: When embedding videos from external platforms, consider the following best practices:\n>\n> * Ensure the video embeds are responsive. Use CSS to make the iframe or video player adapt to different screen sizes.\n> * Implement [strategies for loading videos](https://yoast.com/site-speed-tips-for-faster-video/) based on network conditions, especially for users with limited data plans.\n\nThis approach results in a better user experience as it prevents the page from blocking, meaning the user can interact with the page while the video component streams in.\n\nFor a more engaging and informative loading experience, consider using a loading skeleton as the fallback UI. So instead of showing a simple loading message, you can show a skeleton that resembles the video player like this:\n\napp/page.jsx\n\n```\nimport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport VideoComponent from '../ui/VideoComponent.jsx'\nimport VideoSkeleton from '../ui/VideoSkeleton.jsx'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <Suspense fallback={<VideoSkeleton />}>\n        <VideoComponent />\n      </Suspense>\n      {/* Other content of the page */}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n```",

Here's how you can host a video using Vercel Blob:\n\n**1. Uploading a video to Vercel Blob**\n\nIn your Vercel dashboard, navigate to the \"Storage\" tab and select your [Vercel Blob](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) store. In the Blob table's upper-right corner, find and click the \"Upload\" button. Then, choose the video file you wish to upload. After the upload completes, the video file will appear in the Blob table.\n\nAlternatively, you can upload your video using a server action. For detailed instructions, refer to the Vercel documentation on [server-side uploads](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob/server-upload). Vercel also supports [client-side uploads](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob/client-upload). This method may be preferable for certain use cases.\n\n**2. Displaying the video in Next.js**\n\nOnce the video is uploaded and stored, you can display it in your Next.js application. Here's an example of how to do this using the `<video>` tag and React Suspense:\n\napp/page.jsx\n\n```\nimport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport { list } from '@vercel/blob'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading video...</p>}>\n      <VideoComponent fileName=\"my-video.mp4\" />\n    </Suspense>\n  )\n}\n \nasync function VideoComponent({ fileName }) {\n  const { blobs } = await list({\n    prefix: fileName,\n    limit: 1,\n  })\n  const { url } = blobs[0]\n \n  return (\n    <video controls preload=\"none\" aria-label=\"Video player\">\n      <source src={url} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n      Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    </video>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this approach, the page uses the video's `@vercel/blob` URL to display the video using the `VideoComponent`. React Suspense is used to show a fallback until the video URL is fetched and the video is ready to be displayed.",

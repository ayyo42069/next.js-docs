It requires the user to prove their identity with something they have, such as a username and password.\n2. **[Session Management](#session-management)**: Tracks the user's auth state across requests.\n3. **[Authorization](#authorization)**: Decides what routes and data the user can access.\n\nThis diagram shows the authentication flow using React and Next.js features:\n\n[Image: Diagram showing the authentication flow with React and Next.js features][Image: Diagram showing the authentication flow with React and Next.js features]\n\nThe examples on this page walk through basic username and password auth for educational purposes. While you can implement a custom auth solution, for increased security and simplicity, we recommend using an authentication library. These offer built-in solutions for authentication, session management, and authorization, as well as additional features such as social logins, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control. You can find a list in the [Auth Libraries](#auth-libraries) section.",

    "content": "## [Authentication](#authentication)\n\nHere are the steps to implement a sign-up and/or login form:\n\n1. The user submits their credentials through a form.\n2. The form sends a request that is handled by an API route.\n3. Upon successful verification, the process is completed, indicating the user's successful authentication.\n4. If verification is unsuccessful, an error message is shown.\n\nConsider a login form where users can input their credentials:\n\npages/login.tsx\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\nimport { FormEvent } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function LoginPage() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  async function handleSubmit(event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {\n    event.preventDefault()\n \n    const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget)\n    const email = formData.get('email')\n    const password = formData.get('password')\n \n    const response = await fetch('/api/auth/login', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n      body: JSON.stringify({ email, password }),\n    })\n \n    if (response.ok) {\n      router.push('/profile')\n    } else {\n      // Handle errors\n    }\n  }\n \n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Email\" required />\n      <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" placeholder=\"Password\" required />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Login</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe form above has two input fields for capturing the user's email and password. On submission, it triggers a function that sends a POST request to an API route (`/api/auth/login`).\n\nYou can then call your Authentication Provider's API in the API route to handle authentication:\n\npages/api/auth/login.ts\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\nimport { signIn } from '@/auth'\n \nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  try {\n    const { email, password } = req.body\n    await signIn('credentials', { email, password })\n \n    res.status(200).json({ success: true })\n  } catch (error) {\n    if (error.type === 'CredentialsSignin') {\n      res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials.' })\n    } else {\n      res.status(500).json({ error: 'Something went wrong.' })\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Since Middleware runs on every route, it's a good way to centralize redirect logic and pre-filter unauthorized users.\n* To protect static routes that share data between users (e.g. content behind a paywall).\n\nHowever, since Middleware runs on every route, including [prefetched](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#2-prefetching) routes, it's important to only read the session from the cookie (optimistic checks), and avoid database checks to prevent performance issues.\n\nFor example:\n\nmiddleware.ts\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\nimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport { decrypt } from '@/app/lib/session'\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n \n// 1. Specify protected and public routes\nconst protectedRoutes = ['/dashboard']\nconst publicRoutes = ['/login', '/signup', '/']\n \nexport default async function middleware(req: NextRequest) {\n  // 2. Check if the current route is protected or public\n  const path = req.nextUrl.pathname\n  const isProtectedRoute = protectedRoutes.includes(path)\n  const isPublicRoute = publicRoutes.includes(path)\n \n  // 3. Decrypt the session from the cookie\n  const cookie = (await cookies()).get('session')?.value\n  const session = await decrypt(cookie)\n \n  // 4. Redirect to /login if the user is not authenticated\n  if (isProtectedRoute && !session?.userId) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.nextUrl))\n  }\n \n  // 5. Redirect to /dashboard if the user is authenticated\n  if (\n    isPublicRoute &&\n    session?.userId &&\n    !req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')\n  ) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/dashboard', req.nextUrl))\n  }\n \n  return NextResponse.next()\n}\n \n// Routes Middleware should not run on\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|.*\\\\.png$).*)'],\n}\n```\n\nWhile Middleware can be useful for initial checks, it should not be your only line of defense in protecting your data. The majority of security checks should be performed as close as possible to your data source, see [Data Access Layer](#creating-a-data-access-layer-dal) for more information.\n\n> **Tips**:\n>\n> * In Middleware, you can also read cookies using `req.cookies.get('session').value`.\n> * Middleware uses the [Edge Runtime](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes), check if your Auth library and session management library are compatible.\n> * You can use the `matcher` property in the Middleware to specify which routes Middleware should run on.

This routing paradigm can be useful when you want to display the content of a route without the user switching to a different context.\n\nFor example, when clicking on a photo in a feed, you can display the photo in a modal, overlaying the feed. In this case, Next.js intercepts the `/photo/123` route, masks the URL, and overlays it over `/feed`.\n\n[Image: Intercepting routes soft navigation][Image: Intercepting routes soft navigation]\n\nHowever, when navigating to the photo by clicking a shareable URL or by refreshing the page, the entire photo page should render instead of the modal. No route interception should occur.\n\n[Image: Intercepting routes hard navigation][Image: Intercepting routes hard navigation]",

This allows you to solve common challenges when building modals, such as:\n\n* Making the modal content **shareable through a URL**.\n* **Preserving context** when the page is refreshed, instead of closing the modal.\n* **Closing the modal on backwards navigation** rather than going to the previous route.\n* **Reopening the modal on forwards navigation**.\n\nConsider the following UI pattern, where a user can open a photo modal from a gallery using client-side navigation, or navigate to the photo page directly from a shareable URL:\n\n[Image: Intercepting routes modal example][Image: Intercepting routes modal example]\n\nIn the above example, the path to the `photo` segment can use the `(..)` matcher since `@modal` is a slot and **not** a segment. This means that the `photo` route is only one segment level higher, despite being two file-system levels higher.\n\nSee the [Parallel Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes#modals) documentation for a step-by-step example, or see our [image gallery example](https://github.com/vercel-labs/nextgram).\n\n> **Good to know:**\n>\n> * Other examples could include opening a login modal in a top navbar while also having a dedicated `/login` page, or opening a shopping cart in a side modal.",

When combined with new Next.js features such as [special files](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions) and [layouts](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout), migration means new concepts, mental models, and behavioral changes to learn.\n\nWe recommend reducing the combined complexity of these updates by breaking down your migration into smaller steps. The `app` directory is intentionally designed to work simultaneously with the `pages` directory to allow for incremental page-by-page migration.\n\n* The `app` directory supports nested routes *and* layouts.

[Learn more](#step-4-migrating-pages).\n* [Special file conventions](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions) are used to create UI for each route segment. The most common special files are `page.js` and `layout.js`.\n  + Use `page.js` to define UI unique to a route.\n  + Use `layout.js` to define UI that is shared across multiple routes.\n  + `.js`, `.jsx`, or `.tsx` file extensions can be used for special files.\n* You can colocate other files inside the `app` directory such as components, styles, tests, and more. [Learn more](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing).\n* Data fetching functions like `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` have been replaced with [a new API](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching) inside `app`. `getStaticPaths` has been replaced with [`generateStaticParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params).\n* `pages/_app.js` and `pages/_document.js` have been replaced with a single `app/layout.js` root layout.

Styles in `app/layout.tsx` will *not* apply to `pages/*`. You should keep `_app`/`_document` while migrating to prevent your `pages/*` routes from breaking. Once fully migrated, you can then safely delete them.\n\nIf you are using any React Context providers, they will need to be moved to a [Client Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components).\n\n#### [Migrating the `getLayout()` pattern to Layouts (Optional)](#migrating-the-getlayout-pattern-to-layouts-optional)\n\nNext.js recommended adding a [property to Page components](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#layout-pattern#per-page-layouts) to achieve per-page layouts in the `pages` directory. This pattern can be replaced with native support for [nested layouts](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#layouts) in the `app` directory.\n\nSee before and after example\n\n**Before**\n\ncomponents/DashboardLayout.js\n\n```\nexport default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>My Dashboard</h2>\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\npages/dashboard/index.js\n\n```\nimport DashboardLayout from '../components/DashboardLayout'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <p>My Page</p>\n}\n \nPage.getLayout = function getLayout(page) {\n  return <DashboardLayout>{page}</DashboardLayout>\n}\n```\n\n**After**\n\n* Remove the `Page.getLayout` property from `pages/dashboard/index.js` and follow the [steps for migrating pages](#step-4-migrating-pages) to the `app` directory.\n\n  app/dashboard/page.js\n\n  ```\n  export default function Page() {\n    return <p>My Page</p>\n  }\n  ```\n* Move the contents of `DashboardLayout` into a new [Client Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components) to retain `pages` directory behavior.\n\n  app/dashboard/DashboardLayout.js\n\n  ```\n  'use client' // this directive should be at top of the file, before any imports.\n   \n  // This is a Client Component\n  export default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <h2>My Dashboard</h2>\n        {children}\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n  ```\n* Import the `DashboardLayout` into a new `layout.js` file inside the `app` directory.\n\n  app/dashboard/layout.js\n\n  ```\n  import DashboardLayout from './DashboardLayout'\n   \n  // This is a Server Component\n  export default function Layout({ children }) {\n    return <DashboardLayout>{children}</DashboardLayout>\n  }\n  ```\n* You can incrementally move non-interactive parts of `DashboardLayout.js` (Client Component) into `layout.js` (Server Component) to reduce the amount of component JavaScript you send to the client.",

To define Client Components, add the `'use client'` directive to the top of the file (before any imports).\n  + Similar to the Pages Router, there is an [optimization step](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components#full-page-load) to prerender Client Components to static HTML on the initial page load.\n* Move the default exported page component from `pages/index.js` to `app/home-page.tsx`.\n\napp/home-page.tsx\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\n'use client'\n \n// This is a Client Component (same as components in the `pages` directory)\n// It receives data as props, has access to state and effects, and is\n// prerendered on the server during the initial page load.\nexport default function HomePage({ recentPosts }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {recentPosts.map((post) => (\n        <div key={post.id}>{post.title}</div>\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**Step 2: Create a new page**\n\n* Create a new `app/page.tsx` file inside the `app` directory. This is a Server Component by default.\n* Import the `home-page.tsx` Client Component into the page.\n* If you were fetching data in `pages/index.js`, move the data fetching logic directly into the Server Component using the new [data fetching APIs](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching). See the [data fetching upgrade guide](#step-6-migrating-data-fetching-methods) for more details.\n\n  app/page.tsx\n\n  TypeScript\n\n  JavaScriptTypeScript\n\n  ```\n  // Import your Client Component\n  import HomePage from './home-page'\n   \n  async function getPosts() {\n    const res = await fetch('https://...')\n    const posts = await res.json()\n    return posts\n  }\n   \n  export default async function Page() {\n    // Fetch data directly in a Server Component\n    const recentPosts = await getPosts()\n    // Forward fetched data to your Client Component\n    return <HomePage recentPosts={recentPosts} />\n  }\n  ```\n* If your previous page used `useRouter`, you'll need to update to the new routing hooks.

Use the separate `usePathname` hook instead.\n* The new `useRouter` does not return the `query` object. Search parameters and dynamic route parameters are now separate. Use the `useSearchParams` and `useParams` hooks instead.\n* You can use `useSearchParams` and `usePathname` together to listen to page changes. See the [Router Events](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router#router-events) section for more details.\n* These new hooks are only supported in Client Components. They cannot be used in Server Components.\n\napp/example-client-component.tsx\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\n'use client'\n \nimport { useRouter, usePathname, useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport default function ExampleClientComponent() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n  const pathname = usePathname()\n  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n \n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn addition, the new `useRouter` hook has the following changes:\n\n* `isFallback` has been removed because `fallback` has [been replaced](#replacing-fallback).\n* The `locale`, `locales`, `defaultLocales`, `domainLocales` values have been removed because built-in i18n Next.js features are no longer necessary in the `app` directory. [Learn more about i18n](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/internationalization).\n* `basePath` has been removed. The alternative will not be part of `useRouter`. It has not yet been implemented.\n* `asPath` has been removed because the concept of `as` has been removed from the new router.\n* `isReady` has been removed because it is no longer necessary. During [static rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#static-rendering-default), any component that uses the [`useSearchParams()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params) hook will skip the prerendering step and instead be rendered on the client at runtime.\n* `route` has been removed. `usePathname` or `useSelectedLayoutSegments()` provide an alternative.\n\n[View the `useRouter()` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router).\n\n#### [Sharing components between `pages` and `app`](#sharing-components-between-pages-and-app)\n\nTo keep components compatible between the `pages` and `app` routers, refer to the [`useRouter` hook from `next/compat/router`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router#the-nextcompatrouter-export).\nThis is the `useRouter` hook from the `pages` directory, but intended to be used while sharing components between routers.

    "heading_level": 3,
    "content": "### [Step 6: Migrating Data Fetching Methods](#step-6-migrating-data-fetching-methods)\n\nThe `pages` directory uses `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` to fetch data for pages. Inside the `app` directory, these previous data fetching functions are replaced with a [simpler API](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching) built on top of `fetch()` and `async` React Server Components.\n\napp/page.tsx\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\nexport default async function Page() {\n  // This request should be cached until manually invalidated.\n  // Similar to `getStaticProps`.\n  // `force-cache` is the default and can be omitted.\n  const staticData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'force-cache' })\n \n  // This request should be refetched on every request.\n  // Similar to `getServerSideProps`.\n  const dynamicData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'no-store' })\n \n  // This request should be cached with a lifetime of 10 seconds.\n  // Similar to `getStaticProps` with the `revalidate` option.\n  const revalidatedData = await fetch(`https://...`, {\n    next: { revalidate: 10 },\n  })\n \n  return <div>...</div>\n}\n```\n\n#### [Server-side Rendering (`getServerSideProps`)](#server-side-rendering-getserversideprops)\n\nIn the `pages` directory, `getServerSideProps` is used to fetch data on the server and forward props to the default exported React component in the file. The initial HTML for the page is prerendered from the server, followed by \"hydrating\" the page in the browser (making it interactive).\n\npages/dashboard.js\n\n```\n// `pages` directory\n \nexport async function getServerSideProps() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`)\n  const projects = await res.json()\n \n  return { props: { projects } }\n}\n \nexport default function Dashboard({ projects }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {projects.map((project) => (\n        <li key={project.id}>{project.name}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn the App Router, we can colocate our data fetching inside our React components using [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components). This allows us to send less JavaScript to the client, while maintaining the rendered HTML from the server.\n\nBy setting the `cache` option to `no-store`, we can indicate that the fetched data should [never be cached](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching). This is similar to `getServerSideProps` in the `pages` directory.\n\napp/dashboard/page.tsx\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\n// `app` directory\n \n// This function can be named anything\nasync function getProjects() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'no-store' })\n  const projects = await res.json()\n \n  return projects\n}\n \nexport default async function Dashboard() {\n  const projects = await getProjects()\n \n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {projects.map((project) => (\n        <li key={project.id}>{project.name}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n#### [Accessing Request Object](#accessing-request-object)\n\nIn the `pages` directory, you can retrieve request-based data based on the Node.js HTTP API.\n\nFor example, you can retrieve the `req` object from `getServerSideProps` and use it to retrieve the request's cookies and headers.\n\npages/index.js\n\n```\n// `pages` directory\n \nexport async function getServerSideProps({ req, query }) {\n  const authHeader = req.getHeaders()['authorization'];\n  const theme = req.cookies['theme'];\n \n  return { props: { ... }}\n}\n \nexport default function Page(props) {\n  return ...\n}\n```\n\nThe `app` directory exposes new read-only functions to retrieve request data:\n\n* [`headers`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers): Based on the Web Headers API, and can be used inside [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) to retrieve request headers.\n* [`cookies`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies): Based on the Web Cookies API, and can be used inside [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) to retrieve cookies.\n\napp/page.tsx\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\n// `app` directory\nimport { cookies, headers } from 'next/headers'\n \nasync function getData() {\n  const authHeader = (await headers()).get('authorization')\n \n  return '...'\n}\n \nexport default async function Page() {\n  // You can use `cookies` or `headers` inside Server Components\n  // directly or in your data fetching function\n  const theme = (await cookies()).get('theme')\n  const data = await getData()\n  return '...'\n}\n```\n\n#### [Static Site Generation (`getStaticProps`)](#static-site-generation-getstaticprops)\n\nIn the `pages` directory, the `getStaticProps` function is used to pre-render a page at build time. This function can be used to fetch data from an external API or directly from a database, and pass this data down to the entire page as it's being generated during the build.\n\npages/index.js\n\n```\n// `pages` directory\n \nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`)\n  const projects = await res.json()\n \n  return { props: { projects } }\n}\n \nexport default function Index({ projects }) {\n  return projects.map((project) => <div>{project.name}</div>)\n}\n```\n\nIn the `app` directory, data fetching with [`fetch()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch) will default to `cache: 'force-cache'`, which will cache the request data until manually invalidated. This is similar to `getStaticProps` in the `pages` directory.\n\napp/page.js\n\n```\n// `app` directory\n \n// This function can be named anything\nasync function getProjects() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`)\n  const projects = await res.json()\n \n  return projects\n}\n \nexport default async function Index() {\n  const projects = await getProjects()\n \n  return projects.map((project) => <div>{project.name}</div>)\n}\n```\n\n#### [Dynamic paths (`getStaticPaths`)](#dynamic-paths-getstaticpaths)\n\nIn the `pages` directory, the `getStaticPaths` function is used to define the dynamic paths that should be pre-rendered at build time.\n\npages/posts/[id].js\n\n```\n// `pages` directory\nimport PostLayout from '@/components/post-layout'\n \nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  return {\n    paths: [{ params: { id: '1' } }, { params: { id: '2' } }],\n  }\n}\n \nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts/${params.id}`)\n  const post = await res.json()\n \n  return { props: { post } }\n}\n \nexport default function Post({ post }) {\n  return <PostLayout post={post} />\n}\n```\n\nIn the `app` directory, `getStaticPaths` is replaced with [`generateStaticParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params).\n\n[`generateStaticParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) behaves similarly to `getStaticPaths`, but has a simplified API for returning route parameters and can be used inside [layouts](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates). The return shape of `generateStaticParams` is an array of segments instead of an array of nested `param` objects or a string of resolved paths.\n\napp/posts/[id]/page.js\n\n```\n// `app` directory\nimport PostLayout from '@/components/post-layout'\n \nexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ id: '1' }, { id: '2' }]\n}\n \nasync function getPost(params) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts/${(await params).id}`)\n  const post = await res.json()\n \n  return post\n}\n \nexport default async function Post({ params }) {\n  const post = await getPost(params)\n \n  return <PostLayout post={post} />\n}\n```\n\nUsing the name `generateStaticParams` is more appropriate than `getStaticPaths` for the new model in the `app` directory. The `get` prefix is replaced with a more descriptive `generate`, which sits better alone now that `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps` are no longer necessary. The `Paths` suffix is replaced by `Params`, which is more appropriate for nested routing with multiple dynamic segments.\n\n---\n\n#### [Replacing `fallback`](#replacing-fallback)\n\nIn the `pages` directory, the `fallback` property returned from `getStaticPaths` is used to define the behavior of a page that isn't pre-rendered at build time. This property can be set to `true` to show a fallback page while the page is being generated, `false` to show a 404 page, or `blocking` to generate the page at request time.\n\npages/posts/[id].js\n\n```\n// `pages` directory\n \nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  return {\n    paths: [],\n    fallback: 'blocking'\n  };\n}\n \nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  ...\n}\n \nexport default function Post({ post }) {\n  return ...\n}\n```\n\nIn the `app` directory the [`config.dynamicParams` property](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#dynamicparams) controls how params outside of [`generateStaticParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) are handled:\n\n* **`true`**: (default) Dynamic segments not included in `generateStaticParams` are generated on demand.\n* **`false`**: Dynamic segments not included in `generateStaticParams` will return a 404.\n\nThis replaces the `fallback: true | false | 'blocking'` option of `getStaticPaths` in the `pages` directory. The `fallback: 'blocking'` option is not included in `dynamicParams` because the difference between `'blocking'` and `true` is negligible with streaming.\n\napp/posts/[id]/page.js\n\n```\n// `app` directory\n \nexport const dynamicParams = true;\n \nexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [...]\n}\n \nasync function getPost(params) {\n  ...\n}\n \nexport default async function Post({ params }) {\n  const post = await getPost(params);\n \n  return ...\n}\n```\n\nWith [`dynamicParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#dynamicparams) set to `true` (the default), when a route segment is requested that hasn't been generated, it will be server-rendered and cached.\n\n#### [Incremental Static Regeneration (`getStaticProps` with `revalidate`)](#incremental-static-regeneration-getstaticprops-with-revalidate)\n\nIn the `pages` directory, the `getStaticProps` function allows you to add a `revalidate` field to automatically regenerate a page after a certain amount of time.\n\npages/index.js\n\n```\n// `pages` directory\n \nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts`)\n  const posts = await res.json()\n \n  return {\n    props: { posts },\n    revalidate: 60,\n  }\n}\n \nexport default function Index({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <PostList posts={posts} />\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn the `app` directory, data fetching with [`fetch()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch) can use `revalidate`, which will cache the request for the specified amount of seconds.\n\napp/page.js\n\n```\n// `app` directory\n \nasync function getPosts() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts`, { next: { revalidate: 60 } })\n  const data = await res.json()\n \n  return data.posts\n}\n \nexport default async function PostList() {\n  const posts = await getPosts()\n \n  return posts.map((post) => <div>{post.name}</div>)\n}\n```\n\n#### [API Routes](#api-routes)\n\nAPI Routes continue to work in the `pages/api` directory without any changes. However, they have been replaced by [Route Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) in the `app` directory.\n\nRoute Handlers allow you to create custom request handlers for a given route using the Web [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Request) and [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Response) APIs.\n\napp/api/route.ts\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\nexport async function GET(request: Request) {}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: If you previously used API routes to call an external API from the client, you can now use [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) instead to securely fetch data. Learn more about [data fetching](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching).\n\n#### [Single-Page Applications](#single-page-applications)\n\nIf you are also migrating to Next.js from a Single-Page Application (SPA) at the same time, see our [documentation](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/single-page-applications) to learn more.",

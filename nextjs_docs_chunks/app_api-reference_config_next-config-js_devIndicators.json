Static (or prerendered) routes will display a `\u25cb` symbol, whereas dynamic routes will display a `\u0192` symbol. For example:\n\nBuild Output\n\n```\nRoute (app)                              Size     First Load JS\n\u250c \u25cb /_not-found                          0 B               0 kB\n\u2514 \u0192 /products/[id]                       0 B               0 kB\n \n\u25cb  (Static)   prerendered as static content\n\u0192  (Dynamic)  server-rendered on demand\n```\n\nThere are two reasons a route might opt out of static rendering:\n\n* The presence of [Dynamic APIs](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-apis) which rely on runtime information.\n* An [uncached data request](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching), like a call to an ORM or database driver.\n\nCheck your route for any of these conditions, and if you are not able to statically render the route, then consider using [`loading.js`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading) or [`<Suspense />`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) to leverage [streaming](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#what-is-streaming).",

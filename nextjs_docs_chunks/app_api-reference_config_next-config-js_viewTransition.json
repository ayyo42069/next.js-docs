Try it out and share your feedback on [GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues).\n\n`viewTransition` is an experimental flag that enables the new experimental [View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API) in React. This API allows you to leverage the native View Transitions browser API to create seamless transitions between UI states.\n\nTo enable this feature, you need to set the `viewTransition` property to `true` in your `next.config.js` file.\n\nnext.config.js\n\n```\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  experimental: {\n    viewTransition: true,\n  },\n}\n \nmodule.exports = nextConfig\n```\n\n> Important Notice: This feature is not developed or maintained by the Next.js team \u2014 it is an experimental API from the React team. It is still in **early stages** and **not recommended for production use**. The implementation is still being iterated on, and its behavior may change in future React releases.\n> Enabling this feature requires understanding the experimental nature of the API. To fully grasp its behavior, refer to the [React pull request](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/31975) and related discussions.",

    "content": "### [`sizes`](#sizes)\n\nA string, similar to a media query, that provides information about how wide the image will be at different breakpoints. The value of `sizes` will greatly affect performance for images using [`fill`](#fill) or which are [styled to have a responsive size](#responsive-images).\n\nThe `sizes` property serves two important purposes related to image performance:\n\n* First, the value of `sizes` is used by the browser to determine which size of the image to download, from `next/image`'s automatically generated `srcset`. When the browser chooses, it does not yet know the size of the image on the page, so it selects an image that is the same size or larger than the viewport. The `sizes` property allows you to tell the browser that the image will actually be smaller than full screen. If you don't specify a `sizes` value in an image with the `fill` property, a default value of `100vw` (full screen width) is used.\n* Second, the `sizes` property changes the behavior of the automatically generated `srcset` value. If no `sizes` value is present, a small `srcset` is generated, suitable for a fixed-size image (1x/2x/etc). If `sizes` is defined, a large `srcset` is generated, suitable for a responsive image (640w/750w/etc). If the `sizes` property includes sizes such as `50vw`, which represent a percentage of the viewport width, then the `srcset` is trimmed to not include any values which are too small to ever be necessary.\n\nFor example, if you know your styling will cause an image to be full-width on mobile devices, in a 2-column layout on tablets, and a 3-column layout on desktop displays, you should include a sizes property such as the following:\n\n```\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"grid-element\">\n      <Image\n        fill\n        src=\"/example.png\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw\"\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThis example `sizes` could have a dramatic effect on performance metrics. Without the `33vw` sizes, the image selected from the server would be 3 times as wide as it needs to be. Because file size is proportional to the square of the width, without `sizes` the user would download an image that's 9 times larger than necessary.\n\nLearn more about `srcset` and `sizes`:\n\n* [web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/design/responsive-images/#sizes)\n* [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#sizes)",

When a request is made that matches a cached but expired file, the expired image is served stale immediately. Then the image is optimized again in the background (also called revalidation) and saved to the cache with the new expiration date.\n\nThe cache status of an image can be determined by reading the value of the `x-nextjs-cache` response header. The possible values are the following:\n\n* `MISS` - the path is not in the cache (occurs at most once, on the first visit)\n* `STALE` - the path is in the cache but exceeded the revalidate time so it will be updated in the background\n* `HIT` - the path is in the cache and has not exceeded the revalidate time\n\nThe expiration (or rather Max Age) is defined by either the [`minimumCacheTTL`](#minimumcachettl) configuration or the upstream image `Cache-Control` header, whichever is larger. Specifically, the `max-age` value of the `Cache-Control` header is used. If both `s-maxage` and `max-age` are found, then `s-maxage` is preferred. The `max-age` is also passed-through to any downstream clients including CDNs and browsers.\n\n* You can configure [`minimumCacheTTL`](#minimumcachettl) to increase the cache duration when the upstream image does not include `Cache-Control` header or the value is very low.\n* You can configure [`deviceSizes`](#devicesizes) and [`imageSizes`](#imagesizes) to reduce the total number of possible generated images.\n* You can configure [formats](#formats) to disable multiple formats in favor of a single image format.",

    "content": "# Server-side Rendering (SSR)\n\n> Also referred to as \"SSR\" or \"Dynamic Rendering\".\n\nIf a page uses **Server-side Rendering**, the page HTML is generated on **each request**.\n\nTo use Server-side Rendering for a page, you need to `export` an `async` function called `getServerSideProps`. This function will be called by the server on every request.\n\nFor example, suppose that your page needs to pre-render frequently updated data (fetched from an external API). You can write `getServerSideProps` which fetches this data and passes it to `Page` like below:\n\n```\nexport default function Page({ data }) {\n  // Render data...\n}\n \n// This gets called on every request\nexport async function getServerSideProps() {\n  // Fetch data from external API\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../data`)\n  const data = await res.json()\n \n  // Pass data to the page via props\n  return { props: { data } }\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, `getServerSideProps` is similar to `getStaticProps`, but the difference is that `getServerSideProps` is run on every request instead of on build time.\n\nTo learn more about how `getServerSideProps` works, check out our [Data Fetching documentation](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props).\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\n\nSend",

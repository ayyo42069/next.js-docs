Then, based on the incoming request, you can modify the response by rewriting, redirecting, modifying the request or response headers, or responding directly.\n\nMiddleware executes before routes are rendered. It's particularly useful for implementing custom server-side logic like authentication, logging, or handling redirects.\n\nUse the file `middleware.ts` (or .js) in the root of your project to define Middleware. For example, at the same level as `app` or `pages`, or inside `src` if applicable.\n\nmiddleware.ts\n\nTypeScript\n\nJavaScriptTypeScript\n\n```\nimport { NextResponse, NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \n// This function can be marked `async` if using `await` inside\nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url))\n}\n \nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/about/:path*',\n}\n```",

This object includes the [matcher](#matcher) to specify paths where the Middleware applies.\n\n#### [Matcher](#matcher)\n\nThe `matcher` option allows you to target specific paths for the Middleware to run on. You can specify these paths in several ways:\n\n* For a single path: Directly use a string to define the path, like `'/about'`.\n* For multiple paths: Use an array to list multiple paths, such as `matcher: ['/about', '/contact']`, which applies the Middleware to both `/about` and `/contact`.\n\nAdditionally, `matcher` supports complex path specifications through regular expressions, such as `matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|.*\\\\.png$).*)']`, enabling precise control over which paths to include or exclude.\n\nThe `matcher` option also accepts an array of objects with the following keys:\n\n* `source`: The path or pattern used to match the request paths. It can be a string for direct path matching or a pattern for more complex matching.\n* `regexp` (optional): A regular expression string that fine-tunes the matching based on the source. It provides additional control over which paths are included or excluded.\n* `locale` (optional): A boolean that, when set to `false`, ignores locale-based routing in path matching.\n* `has` (optional): Specifies conditions based on the presence of specific request elements such as headers, query parameters, or cookies.\n* `missing` (optional): Focuses on conditions where certain request elements are absent, like missing headers or cookies.\n\nmiddleware.js\n\n```\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    {\n      source: '/api/*',\n      regexp: '^/api/(.*)',\n      locale: false,\n      has: [\n        { type: 'header', key: 'Authorization', value: 'Bearer Token' },\n        { type: 'query', key: 'userId', value: '123' },\n      ],\n      missing: [{ type: 'cookie', key: 'session', value: 'active' }],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```",

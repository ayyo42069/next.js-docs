    "content": "## [Set up a CDN](#set-up-a-cdn)\n\nTo set up a [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network), you can set up an asset prefix and configure your CDN's origin to resolve to the domain that Next.js is hosted on.\n\nOpen `next.config.mjs` and add the `assetPrefix` config based on the [phase](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js#async-configuration):\n\nnext.config.mjs\n\n```\n// @ts-check\nimport { PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER } from 'next/constants'\n \nexport default (phase) => {\n  const isDev = phase === PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER\n  /**\n   * @type {import('next').NextConfig}\n   */\n  const nextConfig = {\n    assetPrefix: isDev ? undefined : 'https://cdn.mydomain.com',\n  }\n  return nextConfig\n}\n```\n\nNext.js will automatically use your asset prefix for the JavaScript and CSS files it loads from the `/_next/` path (`.next/static/` folder). For example, with the above configuration, the following request for a JS chunk:\n\n```\n/_next/static/chunks/4b9b41aaa062cbbfeff4add70f256968c51ece5d.4d708494b3aed70c04f0.js\n\n```\n\nWould instead become:\n\n```\nhttps://cdn.mydomain.com/_next/static/chunks/4b9b41aaa062cbbfeff4add70f256968c51ece5d.4d708494b3aed70c04f0.js\n\n```\n\nThe exact configuration for uploading your files to a given CDN will depend on your CDN of choice. The only folder you need to host on your CDN is the contents of `.next/static/`, which should be uploaded as `_next/static/` as the above URL request indicates. **Do not upload the rest of your `.next/` folder**, as you should not expose your server code and other configuration to the public.\n\nWhile `assetPrefix` covers requests to `_next/static`, it does not influence the following paths:\n\n* Files in the [public](/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/static-assets) folder; if you want to serve those assets over a CDN, you'll have to introduce the prefix yourself\n* `/_next/data/` requests for `getServerSideProps` pages. These requests will always be made against the main domain since they're not static.\n* `/_next/data/` requests for `getStaticProps` pages. These requests will always be made against the main domain to support [Incremental Static Generation](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration), even if you're not using it (for consistency).\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\n\nSend",

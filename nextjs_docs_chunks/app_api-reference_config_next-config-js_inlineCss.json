This makes inlining a compelling choice because the entire set of styles for the current page is lightweight and doesn\u2019t grow with the page size. Inlining Tailwind styles ensures minimal payload and eliminates the need for additional network requests, which can further enhance performance.",

Inlining CSS eliminates this benefit.\n\nEvaluate these trade-offs carefully, and consider combining inlining with other strategies, such as critical CSS extraction or a hybrid approach, for the best results tailored to your site's needs.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> This feature is currently experimental and has some known limitations:\n>\n> * CSS inlining is applied globally and cannot be configured on a per-page basis\n> * Styles are duplicated during initial page load - once within `<style>` tags for SSR and once in the RSC payload\n> * When navigating to statically rendered pages, styles will use `<link>` tags instead of inline CSS to avoid duplication\n> * This feature is not available in development mode and only works in production builds\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\n\nSend",

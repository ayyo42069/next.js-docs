# devIndicators

`devIndicators` allows you to configure the on-screen indicator that gives context about the current route you're viewing during development.

Types

```
  devIndicators: false | {
    position?: 'bottom-right'
    | 'bottom-left'
    | 'top-right'
    | 'top-left', // defaults to 'bottom-left',
  },
```

Setting `devIndicators` to `false` will hide the indicator, however Next.js will continue to surface any build or runtime errors that were encountered.

## [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

### [Indicator not marking a route as static](#indicator-not-marking-a-route-as-static)

If you expect a route to be static and the indicator has marked it as dynamic, it's likely the route has opted out of static rendering.

You can confirm if a route is [static](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#static-rendering-default) or [dynamic](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-rendering) by building your application using `next build --debug`, and checking the output in your terminal. Static (or prerendered) routes will display a `○` symbol, whereas dynamic routes will display a `ƒ` symbol. For example:

Build Output

```
Route (app)                              Size     First Load JS
┌ ○ /_not-found                          0 B               0 kB
└ ƒ /products/[id]                       0 B               0 kB
 
○  (Static)   prerendered as static content
ƒ  (Dynamic)  server-rendered on demand
```

When exporting [`getServerSideProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props) or [`getInitialProps`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-initial-props) from a page, it will be marked as dynamic.

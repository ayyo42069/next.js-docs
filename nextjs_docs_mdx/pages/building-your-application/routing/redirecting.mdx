# Redirecting

There are a few ways you can handle redirects in Next.js. This page will go through each available option, use cases, and how to manage large numbers of redirects.

| API | Purpose | Where | Status Code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`useRouter`](#userouter-hook) | Perform a client-side navigation | Components | N/A |
| [`redirects` in `next.config.js`](#redirects-in-nextconfigjs) | Redirect an incoming request based on a path | `next.config.js` file | 307 (Temporary) or 308 (Permanent) |
| [`NextResponse.redirect`](#nextresponseredirect-in-middleware) | Redirect an incoming request based on a condition | Middleware | Any |

## [`useRouter()` hook](#userouter-hook)

If you need to redirect inside a component, you can use the `push` method from the `useRouter` hook. For example:

app/page.tsx

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'
 
export default function Page() {
  const router = useRouter()
 
  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={() => router.push('/dashboard')}>
      Dashboard
    </button>
  )
}
```

> **Good to know**:
>
> * If you don't need to programmatically navigate a user, you should use a [`<Link>`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/link) component.

See the [`useRouter` API reference](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router) for more information.

## [`redirects` in `next.config.js`](#redirects-in-nextconfigjs)

The `redirects` option in the `next.config.js` file allows you to redirect an incoming request path to a different destination path. This is useful when you change the URL structure of pages or have a list of redirects that are known ahead of time.

`redirects` supports [path](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/redirects#path-matching), [header, cookie, and query matching](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/redirects#header-cookie-and-query-matching), giving you the flexibility to redirect users based on an incoming request.

To use `redirects`, add the option to your `next.config.js` file:

next.config.ts

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
 
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  async redirects() {
    return [
      // Basic redirect
      {
        source: '/about',
        destination: '/',
        permanent: true,
      },
      // Wildcard path matching
      {
        source: '/blog/:slug',
        destination: '/news/:slug',
        permanent: true,
      },
    ]
  },
}
 
export default nextConfig
```

See the [`redirects` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/redirects) for more information.

> **Good to know**:
>
> * `redirects` can return a 307 (Temporary Redirect) or 308 (Permanent Redirect) status code with the `permanent` option.
> * `redirects` may have a limit on platforms. For example, on Vercel, there's a limit of 1,024 redirects. To manage a large number of redirects (1000+), consider creating a custom solution using [Middleware](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware). See [managing redirects at scale](#managing-redirects-at-scale-advanced) for more.
> * `redirects` runs **before** Middleware.

## [`NextResponse.redirect` in Middleware](#nextresponseredirect-in-middleware)

Middleware allows you to run code before a request is completed. Then, based on the incoming request, redirect to a different URL using `NextResponse.redirect`. This is useful if you want to redirect users based on a condition (e.g. authentication, session management, etc) or have [a large number of redirects](#managing-redirects-at-scale-advanced).

For example, to redirect the user to a `/login` page if they are not authenticated:

middleware.ts

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import { NextResponse, NextRequest } from 'next/server'
import { authenticate } from 'auth-provider'
 
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const isAuthenticated = authenticate(request)
 
  // If the user is authenticated, continue as normal
  if (isAuthenticated) {
    return NextResponse.next()
  }
 
  // Redirect to login page if not authenticated
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url))
}
 
export const config = {
  matcher: '/dashboard/:path*',
}
```

> **Good to know**:
>
> * Middleware runs **after** `redirects` in `next.config.js` and **before** rendering.

See the [Middleware](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) documentation for more information.

## [Managing redirects at scale (advanced)](#managing-redirects-at-scale-advanced)

To manage a large number of redirects (1000+), you may consider creating a custom solution using Middleware. This allows you to handle redirects programmatically without having to redeploy your application.

To do this, you'll need to consider:

1. Creating and storing a redirect map.
2. Optimizing data lookup performance.

> **Next.js Example**: See our [Middleware with Bloom filter](https://redirects-bloom-filter.vercel.app/) example for an implementation of the recommendations below.

### [1. Creating and storing a redirect map](#1-creating-and-storing-a-redirect-map)

A redirect map is a list of redirects that you can store in a database (usually a key-value store) or JSON file.

Consider the following data structure:

```
{
  "/old": {
    "destination": "/new",
    "permanent": true
  },
  "/blog/post-old": {
    "destination": "/blog/post-new",
    "permanent": true
  }
}
```

In [Middleware](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware), you can read from a database such as Vercel's [Edge Config](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/edge-config/get-started?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) or [Redis](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website), and redirect the user based on the incoming request:

middleware.ts

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import { NextResponse, NextRequest } from 'next/server'
import { get } from '@vercel/edge-config'
 
type RedirectEntry = {
  destination: string
  permanent: boolean
}
 
export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const pathname = request.nextUrl.pathname
  const redirectData = await get(pathname)
 
  if (redirectData && typeof redirectData === 'string') {
    const redirectEntry: RedirectEntry = JSON.parse(redirectData)
    const statusCode = redirectEntry.permanent ? 308 : 307
    return NextResponse.redirect(redirectEntry.destination, statusCode)
  }
 
  // No redirect found, continue without redirecting
  return NextResponse.next()
}
```

### [2. Optimizing data lookup performance](#2-optimizing-data-lookup-performance)

Reading a large dataset for every incoming request can be slow and expensive. There are two ways you can optimize data lookup performance:

* Use a database that is optimized for fast reads, such as [Vercel Edge Config](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/edge-config/get-started?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) or [Redis](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website).
* Use a data lookup strategy such as a [Bloom filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter) to efficiently check if a redirect exists **before** reading the larger redirects file or database.

Considering the previous example, you can import a generated bloom filter file into Middleware, then, check if the incoming request pathname exists in the bloom filter.

If it does, forward the request to a  [API Routes](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) which will check the actual file and redirect the user to the appropriate URL. This avoids importing a large redirects file into Middleware, which can slow down every incoming request.

middleware.ts

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import { NextResponse, NextRequest } from 'next/server'
import { ScalableBloomFilter } from 'bloom-filters'
import GeneratedBloomFilter from './redirects/bloom-filter.json'
 
type RedirectEntry = {
  destination: string
  permanent: boolean
}
 
// Initialize bloom filter from a generated JSON file
const bloomFilter = ScalableBloomFilter.fromJSON(GeneratedBloomFilter as any)
 
export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // Get the path for the incoming request
  const pathname = request.nextUrl.pathname
 
  // Check if the path is in the bloom filter
  if (bloomFilter.has(pathname)) {
    // Forward the pathname to the Route Handler
    const api = new URL(
      `/api/redirects?pathname=${encodeURIComponent(request.nextUrl.pathname)}`,
      request.nextUrl.origin
    )
 
    try {
      // Fetch redirect data from the Route Handler
      const redirectData = await fetch(api)
 
      if (redirectData.ok) {
        const redirectEntry: RedirectEntry | undefined =
          await redirectData.json()
 
        if (redirectEntry) {
          // Determine the status code
          const statusCode = redirectEntry.permanent ? 308 : 307
 
          // Redirect to the destination
          return NextResponse.redirect(redirectEntry.destination, statusCode)
        }
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error)
    }
  }
 
  // No redirect found, continue the request without redirecting
  return NextResponse.next()
}
```



Then, in the API Route:

pages/api/redirects.ts

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'
import redirects from '@/app/redirects/redirects.json'
 
type RedirectEntry = {
  destination: string
  permanent: boolean
}
 
export default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const pathname = req.query.pathname
  if (!pathname) {
    return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Bad Request' })
  }
 
  // Get the redirect entry from the redirects.json file
  const redirect = (redirects as Record<string, RedirectEntry>)[pathname]
 
  // Account for bloom filter false positives
  if (!redirect) {
    return res.status(400).json({ message: 'No redirect' })
  }
 
  // Return the redirect entry
  return res.json(redirect)
}
```

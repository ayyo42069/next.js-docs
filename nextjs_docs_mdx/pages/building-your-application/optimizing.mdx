# Optimizations

Next.js comes with a variety of built-in optimizations designed to improve your application's speed and [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/). This guide will cover the optimizations you can leverage to enhance your user experience.

## [Built-in Components](#built-in-components)

Built-in components abstract away the complexity of implementing common UI optimizations. These components are:

* **Images**: Built on the native `<img>` element. The Image Component optimizes images for performance by lazy loading and automatically resizing images based on device size.
* **Link**: Built on the native `<a>` tags. The Link Component prefetches pages in the background, for faster and smoother page transitions.
* **Scripts**: Built on the native `<script>` tags. The Script Component gives you control over loading and execution of third-party scripts.

## [Metadata](#metadata)

Metadata helps search engines understand your content better (which can result in better SEO), and allows you to customize how your content is presented on social media, helping you create a more engaging and consistent user experience across various platforms.

The Head Component in Next.js allows you to modify the `<head>` of a page. Learn more in the [Head Component](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/head) documentation.

## [Static Assets](#static-assets)

Next.js `/public` folder can be used to serve static assets like images, fonts, and other files. Files inside `/public` can also be cached by CDN providers so that they are delivered efficiently.

## [Analytics and Monitoring](#analytics-and-monitoring)

For large applications, Next.js integrates with popular analytics and monitoring tools to help you understand how your application is performing. Learn more in the [Analytics](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/analytics),  [OpenTelemetry](/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/open-telemetry), and [Instrumentation](/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation) guides.

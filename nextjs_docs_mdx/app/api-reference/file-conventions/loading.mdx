# loading.js

A **loading** file can create instant loading states built on [Suspense](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming).

By default, this file is a [Server Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) - but can also be used as a Client Component through the `"use client"` directive.

```
export default function Loading() {
  // Or a custom loading skeleton component
  return <p>Loading...</p>
}
```

Loading UI components do not accept any parameters.

> **Good to know**:
>
> * While designing loading UI, you may find it helpful to use the [React Developer Tools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools) to manually toggle Suspense boundaries.

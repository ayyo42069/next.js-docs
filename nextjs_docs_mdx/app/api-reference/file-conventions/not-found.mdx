[API Reference](/docs/app/api-reference)[File Conventions](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions)not-found.js

# not-found.js

The **not-found** file is used to render UI when the [`notFound`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/not-found) function is thrown within a route segment. Along with serving a custom UI, Next.js will return a `200` HTTP status code for streamed responses, and `404` for non-streamed responses.

app/not-found.tsx

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import Link from 'next/link'
 
export default function NotFound() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Not Found</h2>
      <p>Could not find requested resource</p>
      <Link href="/">Return Home</Link>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## [Reference](#reference)

### [Props](#props)

`not-found.js` components do not accept any props.

> **Good to know**: In addition to catching expected `notFound()` errors, the root `app/not-found.js` file also handles any unmatched URLs for your whole application. This means users that visit a URL that is not handled by your app will be shown the UI exported by the `app/not-found.js` file.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Data Fetching](#data-fetching)

By default, `not-found` is a Server Component. You can mark it as `async` to fetch and display data:

app/not-found.tsx

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import Link from 'next/link'
import { headers } from 'next/headers'
 
export default async function NotFound() {
  const headersList = await headers()
  const domain = headersList.get('host')
  const data = await getSiteData(domain)
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Not Found: {data.name}</h2>
      <p>Could not find requested resource</p>
      <p>
        View <Link href="/blog">all posts</Link>
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

If you need to use Client Component hooks like `usePathname` to display content based on the path, you must fetch data on the client-side instead.

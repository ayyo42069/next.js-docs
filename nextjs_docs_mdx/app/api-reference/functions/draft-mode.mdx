# draftMode

`draftMode` is an **async** function allows you to enable and disable [Draft Mode](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/draft-mode), as well as check if Draft Mode is enabled in a [Server Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components).

app/page.ts

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import { draftMode } from 'next/headers'
 
export default async function Page() {
  const { isEnabled } = await draftMode()
}
```

## [Reference](#reference)

The following methods and properties are available:

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `isEnabled` | A boolean value that indicates if Draft Mode is enabled. |
| `enable()` | Enables Draft Mode in a Route Handler by setting a cookie (`__prerender_bypass`). |
| `disable()` | Disables Draft Mode in a Route Handler by deleting a cookie. |

## [Good to know](#good-to-know)

* `draftMode` is an **asynchronous** function that returns a promise. You must use `async/await` or React's [`use`](https://react.dev/reference/react/use) function.
  + In version 14 and earlier, `draftMode` was a synchronous function. To help with backwards compatibility, you can still access it synchronously in Next.js 15, but this behavior will be deprecated in the future.
* A new bypass cookie value will be generated each time you run `next build`. This ensures that the bypass cookie canâ€™t be guessed.
* To test Draft Mode locally over HTTP, your browser will need to allow third-party cookies and local storage access.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Enabling Draft Mode](#enabling-draft-mode)

To enable Draft Mode, create a new [Route Handler](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) and call the `enable()` method:

app/draft/route.ts

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import { draftMode } from 'next/headers'
 
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const draft = await draftMode()
  draft.enable()
  return new Response('Draft mode is enabled')
}
```

### [Disabling Draft Mode](#disabling-draft-mode)

By default, the Draft Mode session ends when the browser is closed.

To disable Draft Mode manually, call the `disable()` method in your [Route Handler](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers):

app/draft/route.ts

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import { draftMode } from 'next/headers'
 
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const draft = await draftMode()
  draft.disable()
  return new Response('Draft mode is disabled')
}
```

Then, send a request to invoke the Route Handler. If calling the route using the [`<Link>` component](/docs/app/api-reference/components/link), you must pass `prefetch={false}` to prevent accidentally deleting the cookie on prefetch.

### [Checking if Draft Mode is enabled](#checking-if-draft-mode-is-enabled)

You can check if Draft Mode is enabled in a Server Component with the `isEnabled` property:

app/page.ts

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import { draftMode } from 'next/headers'
 
export default async function Page() {
  const { isEnabled } = await draftMode()
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>My Blog Post</h1>
      <p>Draft Mode is currently {isEnabled ? 'Enabled' : 'Disabled'}</p>
    </main>
  )
}
```

## [Version History](#version-history)

| Version | Changes |

| `v15.0.0-RC` | `draftMode` is now an async function. A [codemod](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#150) is available. |
| `v13.4.0` | `draftMode` introduced. |

# usePathname

`usePathname` is a **Client Component** hook that lets you read the current URL's **pathname**.

app/example-client-component.tsx

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
'use client'
 
import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'
 
export default function ExampleClientComponent() {
  const pathname = usePathname()
  return <p>Current pathname: {pathname}</p>
}
```

`usePathname` intentionally requires using a [Client Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components). It's important to note Client Components are not a de-optimization. They are an integral part of the [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) architecture.

For example, a Client Component with `usePathname` will be rendered into HTML on the initial page load. When navigating to a new route, this component does not need to be re-fetched. Instead, the component is downloaded once (in the client JavaScript bundle), and re-renders based on the current state.

> **Good to know**:
>
> * Reading the current URL from a [Server Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) is not supported. This design is intentional to support layout state being preserved across page navigations.
> * Compatibility mode:
>   + `usePathname` can return `null` when a [fallback route](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths#fallback-true) is being rendered or when a `pages` directory page has been [automatically statically optimized](/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/automatic-static-optimization) by Next.js and the router is not ready.
>   + When using `usePathname` with rewrites in [`next.config`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/rewrites) or [`Middleware`](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware), `useState` and `useEffect` must also be used in order to avoid hydration mismatch errors.
>   + Next.js will automatically update your types if it detects both an `app` and `pages` directory in your project.

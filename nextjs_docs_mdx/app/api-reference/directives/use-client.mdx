# use client

The `use client` directive designates a component to be rendered on the **client side** and should be used when creating interactive user interfaces (UI) that require client-side JavaScript capabilities, such as state management, event handling, and access to browser APIs. This is a React feature.

## [Usage](#usage)

To designate a component as a Client Component, add the `use client` directive **at the top of the file**, before any imports:

app/components/counter.tsx

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
'use client'
 
import { useState } from 'react'
 
export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
 
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## [Nesting Client Components within Server Components](#nesting-client-components-within-server-components)

Combining Server and Client Components allows you to build applications that are both performant and interactive:

1. **Server Components**: Use for static content, data fetching, and SEO-friendly elements.
2. **Client Components**: Use for interactive elements that require state, effects, or browser APIs.
3. **Component composition**: Nest Client Components within Server Components as needed for a clear separation of server and client logic.

In the following example:

* `Header` is a Server Component handling static content.
* `Counter` is a Client Component enabling interactivity within the page.

app/page.tsx

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import Header from './header'
import Counter from './counter' // This is a Client Component
 
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <Counter />
    </div>
  )
}
```

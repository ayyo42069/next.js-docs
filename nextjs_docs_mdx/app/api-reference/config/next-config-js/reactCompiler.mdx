# reactCompiler

This feature is currently experimental and subject to change, it's not recommended for production. Try it out and share your feedback on [GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues).

Next.js 15 introduced support for the [React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler). The compiler improves performance by automatically optimizing component rendering. This reduces the amount of manual memoization developers have to do through APIs such as `useMemo` and `useCallback`.

To use it, upgrade to Next.js 15, install the `babel-plugin-react-compiler`:

Terminal

```
npm install babel-plugin-react-compiler
```

Then, add `experimental.reactCompiler` option in `next.config.js`:

next.config.ts

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
 
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    reactCompiler: true,
  },
}
 
export default nextConfig
```

> **Note:** The React Compiler is currently only possible to use in Next.js through a Babel plugin. This will opt-out of Next.js's default [Rust-based compiler](/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler), which could result in slower build times. We are working on support for the React Compiler as our default compiler.

## [Annotations](#annotations)

You can configure the compiler to run in "opt-in" mode as follows:

next.config.ts

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
 
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    reactCompiler: {
      compilationMode: 'annotation',
    },
  },
}
 
export default nextConfig
```

Then, you can annotate specific components or hooks with the `"use memo"` directive from React to opt-in:

app/page.tsx

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
export default function Page() {
  'use memo'
  // ...
}
```

> **Note:** You can also use the `"use no memo"` directive from React for the opposite effect, to opt-out a component or hook.

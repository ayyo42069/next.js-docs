# compress

By default, Next.js uses `gzip` to compress rendered content and static files when using `next start` or a custom server. This is an optimization for applications that do not have compression configured. If compression is *already* configured in your application via a custom server, Next.js will not add compression.

> **Good to know:**
>
> * When hosting your application on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/compression), compression uses `brotli` first, then `gzip`.
> * You can check if compression is enabled and which algorithm is used by looking at the [`Accept-Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) (browser accepted options) and [`Content-Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Encoding) (currently used) headers in the response.

## [Disabling compression](#disabling-compression)

To disable **compression**, set the `compress` config option to `false`:

next.config.js

```
module.exports = {
  compress: false,
}
```

We do not recommend disabling compression unless you have compression configured on your server, as compression reduces bandwidth usage and improves the performance of your application.

## [Changing the compression algorithm](#changing-the-compression-algorithm)

To change your compression algorithm, you will need to configure your custom server and set the `compress` option to `false` in your `next.config.js` file.

For example, you're using [nginx](https://nginx.org/) and want to switch to `brotli`, set the `compress` option to `false` to allow nginx to handle compression.

> **Good to know:**
>
> * For Next.js applications on Vercel, compression is handled by the Vercel's Edge Network and not Next.js. See the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/compression) for more information.

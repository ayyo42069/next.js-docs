# staleTimes

This feature is currently experimental and subject to change, it's not recommended for production. Try it out and share your feedback on [GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues).

`staleTimes` is an experimental feature that enables caching of page segments in the [client-side router cache](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#client-side-router-cache).

You can enable this experimental feature and provide custom revalidation times by setting the experimental `staleTimes` flag:

next.config.js

```
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    staleTimes: {
      dynamic: 30,
      static: 180,
    },
  },
}
 
module.exports = nextConfig
```

The `static` and `dynamic` properties correspond with the time period (in seconds) based on different types of [link prefetching](/docs/app/api-reference/components/link#prefetch).

* The `dynamic` property is used when the page is neither statically generated nor fully prefetched (e.g. with `prefetch={true}`).
  + Default: 0 seconds (not cached)
* The `static` property is used for statically generated pages, or when the `prefetch` prop on `Link` is set to `true`, or when calling [`router.prefetch`](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#routerprefetch).
  + Default: 5 minutes

> **Good to know:**
>
> * [Loading boundaries](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading) are considered reusable for the `static` period defined in this configuration.
> * This doesn't affect [partial rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#4-partial-rendering), **meaning shared layouts won't automatically be refetched on every navigation, only the page segment that changes.**
> * This doesn't change [back/forward caching](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#client-side-router-cache) behavior to prevent layout shift and to prevent losing the browser scroll position.

This feature is currently experimental and subject to change, it's not recommended for production. Try it out and share your feedback on [GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues).

Partial Prerendering (PPR) enables you to combine static and dynamic components together in the same route. Learn more about [PPR](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/partial-prerendering).

### [Incremental Adoption (Version 15)](#incremental-adoption-version-15)

In Next.js 15, you can incrementally adopt Partial Prerendering in [layouts](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates) and [pages](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page) by setting the [`ppr`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/ppr) option in `next.config.js` to `incremental`, and exporting the `experimental_ppr` [route config option](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config) at the top of the file:

next.config.ts

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
 
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    ppr: 'incremental',
  },
}
 
export default nextConfig
```

app/page.tsx

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import { Suspense } from "react"
import { StaticComponent, DynamicComponent, Fallback } from "@/app/ui"
 
export const experimental_ppr = true
 
export default function Page() {
  return {
     <>
      <StaticComponent />
      <Suspense fallback={<Fallback />}>
        <DynamicComponent />
      </Suspense>
     </>
  };
}
```

> **Good to know**:
>
> * Routes that don't have `experimental_ppr` will default to `false` and will not be prerendered using PPR. You need to explicitly opt-in to PPR for each route.
> * `experimental_ppr` will apply to all children of the route segment, including nested layouts and pages. You don't have to add it to every file, only the top segment of a route.
> * To disable PPR for children segments, you can set `experimental_ppr` to `false` in the child segment.

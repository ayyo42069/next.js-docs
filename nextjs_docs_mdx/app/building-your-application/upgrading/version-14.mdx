### [v14 Summary](#v14-summary)

* The minimum Node.js version has been bumped from 16.14 to 18.17, since 16.x has reached end-of-life.
* The `next export` command has been removed in favor of `output: 'export'` config. Please see the [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) for more information.
* The `next/server` import for `ImageResponse` was renamed to `next/og`. A [codemod is available](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#next-og-import) to safely and automatically rename your imports.
* The `@next/font` package has been fully removed in favor of the built-in `next/font`. A [codemod is available](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#built-in-next-font) to safely and automatically rename your imports.
* The WASM target for `next-swc` has been removed.

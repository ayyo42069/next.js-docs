# Intercepting Routes

Intercepting routes allows you to load a route from another part of your application within the current layout. This routing paradigm can be useful when you want to display the content of a route without the user switching to a different context.

For example, when clicking on a photo in a feed, you can display the photo in a modal, overlaying the feed. In this case, Next.js intercepts the `/photo/123` route, masks the URL, and overlays it over `/feed`.

However, when navigating to the photo by clicking a shareable URL or by refreshing the page, the entire photo page should render instead of the modal. No route interception should occur.

## [Convention](#convention)

Intercepting routes can be defined with the `(..)` convention, which is similar to relative path convention `../` but for segments.

You can use:

* `(.)` to match segments on the **same level**
* `(..)` to match segments **one level above**
* `(..)(..)` to match segments **two levels above**
* `(...)` to match segments from the **root** `app` directory

For example, you can intercept the `photo` segment from within the `feed` segment by creating a `(..)photo` directory.

> Note that the `(..)` convention is based on *route segments*, not the file-system.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Modals](#modals)

Intercepting Routes can be used together with [Parallel Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes) to create modals. This allows you to solve common challenges when building modals, such as:

* Making the modal content **shareable through a URL**.
* **Preserving context** when the page is refreshed, instead of closing the modal.
* **Closing the modal on backwards navigation** rather than going to the previous route.
* **Reopening the modal on forwards navigation**.

Consider the following UI pattern, where a user can open a photo modal from a gallery using client-side navigation, or navigate to the photo page directly from a shareable URL:

[Image: Intercepting routes modal example][Image: Intercepting routes modal example]

In the above example, the path to the `photo` segment can use the `(..)` matcher since `@modal` is a slot and **not** a segment. This means that the `photo` route is only one segment level higher, despite being two file-system levels higher.

See the [Parallel Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes#modals) documentation for a step-by-step example, or see our [image gallery example](https://github.com/vercel-labs/nextgram).

Simultaneously render one or more pages in the same view that can be navigated independently. A pattern for highly dynamic applications.](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes)

# No Cache Detected

## [Why This Error Occurred](#why-this-error-occurred)

A Next.js build was triggered in a continuous integration environment, but no cache was detected.

This results in slower builds and can hurt Next.js' persistent caching of client-side bundles across builds.

## [Possible Ways to Fix It](#possible-ways-to-fix-it)

> **Note**: If this is a new project, or being built for the first time in your CI, you can ignore this error.
> However, you'll want to make sure it doesn't continue to happen and fix it if it does!

Follow the instructions in [CI Build Caching](/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/ci-build-caching) to ensure your Next.js cache is persisted between builds.

# No Unwanted Polyfill.io

> Prevent duplicate polyfills from Polyfill.io.

## [Why This Error Occurred](#why-this-error-occurred)

You are using polyfills from Polyfill.io and including polyfills already shipped with Next.js. This unnecessarily increases page weight which can affect loading performance.

## [Possible Ways to Fix It](#possible-ways-to-fix-it)

Remove all duplicate polyfills. If you need to add polyfills but are not sure if Next.js already includes it, take a look at the list of [supported browsers and features](/docs/architecture/supported-browsers).

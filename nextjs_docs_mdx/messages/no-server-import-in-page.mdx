# No Server Import In Page

> Prevent usage of `next/server` outside of `middleware.js`.

## [Why This Error Occurred](#why-this-error-occurred)

`next/server` was imported outside of `middleware.{js,ts}`.

## [Possible Ways to Fix It](#possible-ways-to-fix-it)

Only import and use `next/server` in a file located within the project root directory: `middleware.{js,ts}`.

middleware.ts

```
import type { NextFetchEvent, NextRequest } from 'next/server'
 
export function middleware(req: NextRequest, ev: NextFetchEvent) {
  return new Response('Hello, world!')
}
```

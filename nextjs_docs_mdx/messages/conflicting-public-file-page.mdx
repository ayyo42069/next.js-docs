# Conflicting Public File and Page File

## [Why This Error Occurred](#why-this-error-occurred)

One of your public files has the same path as a page file which is not supported. Since only one resource can reside at the URL both public files and page files must be unique.

## [Possible Ways to Fix It](#possible-ways-to-fix-it)

Rename either the public file or page file that is causing the conflict.

Example conflict between public file and page file

Folder structure

```
public/
  hello
pages/
  hello.js
```

Non-conflicting public file and page file

Folder structure

```
public/
  hello.txt
pages/
  hello.js
```
